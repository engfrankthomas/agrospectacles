System features 
Functional requirements
What the system should I do?
1. The system should be able to take pictures 
2. The system should be able to send pictures to the application server for analysis
3. The system should be able to analyze picture received from the farmer
4. The system should be able to compare analysis and give results
5. The system should be able to allow agronomist to review analysis
6. The system should be able to register farmers, agronomist, researcher and institutions 
7. The system should have database of crop pests and diseases
8. The system should provide technical support to farmers
9. The system should be able to generate both technical and simple report for farmers
10. The device should be able to be used multiple farmers and have simple language (Kiswahili and English)

Nonfunctional requirements 
These are divided in three categories:
1. Organization nonfunctional requirement 
2. Product nonfunctional requirement and 
3. External nonfunctional requirement. 

Product nonfunctional requirements
1. The system should be efficient
2. The system should be reliable
3. Farmers information should be confidential
4. No farmer’s information are stored on a device 
5. The device should be portable
6. The device should be maintainable 

Business rules 
1. Farmers buy a device 
2. Researchers subscribe for a service
3. Agronomists get paid to provide services
